The "Coffee Machine Simulator" is a Python class designed to emulate the functionality of a coffee machine, providing users with an interactive experience of brewing different types of coffee. Just as the "Bill-Splitting Calculator for a Party" simplifies expense distribution, the Coffee Machine Simulator simplifies the process of preparing coffee with various customization options.

Key Features:

Interactive Interaction: The class engages users in an interactive session, prompting them to choose actions such as buying coffee, refilling resources, taking earnings, checking inventory, and even exiting the interaction. This facilitates seamless user engagement and control over the coffee-making process.

Coffee Customization: Similar to the lucky draw feature in the bill-splitting script, the Coffee Machine Simulator allows users to select from different coffee types (espresso, latte, cappuccino). Each type has its unique set of resource requirements (water, milk, coffee beans) and cost, enhancing the user's experience by offering customization.

Resource Management: The class employs an algorithm to check whether there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee beans, cups) to prepare the chosen coffee type. If resources are sufficient, the simulator makes the coffee, deducts the used resources, and adds the corresponding cost to the machine's earnings.

Output Display: Just like the bill-splitting script's output display, the Coffee Machine Simulator showcases the current inventory of resources, including water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, and money. This clear display keeps users informed about the machine's status.
