# Coffee Machine Simulator

This Python program simulates a coffee machine that allows users to buy different types of coffee, fill the machine with resources, take out money, and check the remaining inventory. The program utilizes object-oriented programming to model the coffee machine's behavior.

## Features

- Provides the ability to buy three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- Allows refilling the coffee machine with water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups.
- Enables users to withdraw the money earned from selling coffee.
- Displays the current inventory of the coffee machine.

## Instructions

1. Run the Python program in an environment that supports Python.
2. The program will create an instance of the `CoffeeMachine` class and start the interaction with the coffee machine.
3. The program will prompt you for actions such as buying coffee, refilling resources, taking money, checking inventory, or exiting the program.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- The program uses object-oriented programming to encapsulate the coffee machine's behavior within a class.
- Users can select the type of coffee they want to buy by inputting the respective number.
- When refilling the coffee machine, provide the quantities of water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups to be added.
- The program provides an inventory display of the coffee machine's current resources.
- You can modify the program to add more coffee types or customize the resource requirements.
- The `interact` method maintains an ongoing interaction with the user until they choose to exit.

Feel free to modify and enhance this code according to your preferences. Enjoy running your virtual coffee machine and exploring its functionalities!
